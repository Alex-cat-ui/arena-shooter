============================================================
NAVIGATION PATH CONTRACT ROUTE SOURCE TEST
============================================================
[PASS] path contract: fallback status ok
[PASS] path contract: route_source is room_graph on no-navmesh fallback
[PASS] path contract: route_source_reason is present
[PASS] path contract: obstacle_intersection_detected false on clean fallback
[PASS] path contract: obstacle intersection returns unreachable_geometry
[PASS] path contract: obstacle intersection reason is explicit
[PASS] path contract: obstacle_intersection_detected true on intersection
[PASS] path contract: navmesh map uses navmesh route_source
[PASS] path contract: navmesh no path keeps reason
[PASS] path contract: disabling fallback yields unreachable_geometry
[PASS] path contract: disabling fallback reason is room_graph_fallback_disabled
[PASS] path contract: disabling fallback keeps room_graph route_source
